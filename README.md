# Client Data Storage
**Version 0.0.2 Beta**

Using the Client Data Storage library, we can perform data management on the client side with a larger size than using regular storage, but also efficiently. This library uses Indexeddb to run the system. So we need to make sure that the device we are using supports Indexed DB. Because the storage system uses Indexed DB, the storage object is JSON (NoSQL Database).
